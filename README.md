> [!TIP]
> Check out **[EmailEngine](https://emailengine.app/?utm_source=github-nodemailer&utm_campaign=nodemailer&utm_medium=readme-link)** – a self-hosted email gateway that allows making **REST requests against IMAP and SMTP servers**. EmailEngine also sends webhooks whenever something changes on the registered accounts.\
> \
> Using the email accounts registered with EmailEngine, you can receive and [send emails](https://emailengine.app/sending-emails?utm_source=github-nodemailer&utm_campaign=nodemailer&utm_medium=readme-link). EmailEngine supports OAuth2, delayed sends, opens and clicks tracking, bounce detection, etc. All on top of regular email accounts without an external MTA service.
